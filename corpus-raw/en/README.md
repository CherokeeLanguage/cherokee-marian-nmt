The Catholic Public Domain Version, Original Edition was completed on March 28th, 2009. This version of the Bible is called the Catholic Public Domain Version (CPDV) of the Holy Bible. The Catholic Public Domain Version of the Bible is a translation of the Sacred Bible, Sixtus V and Clement VIII Latin Vulgate edition. Three different versions of the Latin Bible were used in making this translation: the 1861 edition edited by C. Vercellone, the 1885 edition published by Desclee, and the 1914 edition edited by M. Hetzenauer. The 1914 edition was the main text used for the translation, while the other two texts were consulted from time to time. A public domain edition of the Challoner Douay-Rheims Version of the Bible was used as a guide in translating the Latin Bible into English. See http://www.sacredbible.org/catholic/version.htm
